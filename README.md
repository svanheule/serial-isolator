# Dual serial isolator

Small board design for a single MAX12930/MAX12931 isolator chip.

Since the MAX12930 and MAX12931 have a similar pin-out, a single board can be
used to exposed their input and output pins. The spacing of the board's pin
rows is chosen such that the board can easily be mounted on a breadboard.

Note that there is no reverse voltage protection included, so always pay
attentention when hooking up VCC/GND.
